Question:
Suppose that you are given source code for a DBMS that does not support indexing.
This code was extensively tested, so we have a high degree of confidence that it works correctly.
Now you were asked to extend the code, such that the indexing is supported.
How would you test your extended code to make sure it works properly with indexing?
Note that you don't need to provide any additional code for this question, just the answer.

Firt of all, I will get a set of different element from database as further from header as better
to see seaching time
After that, create the indexed and compare with the former test (usually faster if extend right)
Looking for smaller data as the attribue of B-tree index show it is not sufficient for small data
(in this case linear could be equal or better than Btree)
Finally, check the logic of the code to make sure there aren't any duplicate or false notification which
make the test not consistence (usually came to first for clear test)
